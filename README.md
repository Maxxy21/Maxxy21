#  Hi, I'm Maxwell 👋

Software developer based in Hamburg. I build tools that save people time.

Currently at Amazon where I built a browser extension that turned a 15-minute copy-paste workflow into a one-click operation. My 6-person operations team uses it every day.

## 🚀 What I do

- 💼Right now: Operations Associate at Amazon Hamburg
- 🎓 Background: Just graduated with a CS degree from Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (October 2025)
- 🔧 Built production browser extension, AI pitch evaluator, and DevOps automation tools
- 🌍 Based in Hamburg, open to opportunities across Germany
- 💬 English (Native), German (B2), Italian (C1)

I work full-stack - React and TypeScript on the frontend, Spring Boot and Node.js on the backend. I also set up CI/CD pipelines and dashboards when needed.


## 🛠️ Tech I use

**Frontend:** React.js, Next.js, React Native, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML/CSS 
**Backend:** Node.js, Spring Boot, Java, Python, REST APIs 
**Backend:** PostgreSQL, MySQL
**DevOps:** GitHub Actions, Docker, AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda), CI/CD

## 📌 Projects worth checking out

### 🎯 [Pista - AI Startup Pitch Evaluator](https://github.com/Maxxy21/startup-pitches)
> My bachelor thesis. Built a Next.js app that evaluates startup pitches using AI (OpenAI/Claude/Gemini APIs). The challenge was getting it to give useful feedback instead of generic scores, had to engineer the prompts carefully to avoid score clustering where everything gets a 7/10.

**Stack:** Next.js 15, TypeScript, Convex, Clerk OpenAI API  
🔗 [Live Demo](https://pista-app.vercel.app)

### 🔧 [DSP Management Extension](https://github.com/Maxxy21/dsp-extension-hosting)
> Browser extension I built for my team at Amazon. Automates delivery partner communications - what used to take 15 minutes (Excel pivot tables, filtering, copy-pasting to individual channels) now takes one click. Also added broadcast messaging. Set up the CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions so the team can deploy updates themselves.

**Stack:** JavaScript, WebExtensions API, GitHub Actions  
**Impact:** Used daily by operations team

### 🎮 [Wordle Clone - React Native](https://github.com/Maxxy21/Wordle-React-Native)
> Cross-platform Wordle game (iOS/Android/Web). Built it to learn React Native. Has game stats, hard mode, and persistent storage with AsyncStorage.

**Stack:** React Native, TypeScript, Expo

### ☁️  [Tourism Data Analyzer](https://github.com/Maxxy21/Programming-Project-OpenHub)
> ETL pipeline that processes 10,000+ tourism records from the Open Data Hub API using multithreaded Java. Ran into heap space issues with the full dataset and fixed it by optimizing memory usage and HTTP connection pooling.

**Stack:** Java, Gson/Jackson, REST APIs, Naven
